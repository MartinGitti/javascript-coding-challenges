# javascript-coding-challenges
The type of challenges one could expect from an interview.

## Please note:

* In order to run code in the console, it is important to install Node.js first.
* Run code or display variables in the console by typing 'node & [File Name]'.
* Example: 'node codingChallenges.js'.
* Bare in mind that this needs to be typed within the command line interface/terminal.
